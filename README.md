# 1. INTRDUCTION

   Welcome to the Chicago Car Crashes project, where we will be conducting a comprehensive research on the causes and impacts of car crashes in the city of Chicago. With a growing concern over road safety, it is crucial that we understand the factors contributing to car crashes and develop effective strategies to mitigate them. This research project aims to provide valuable insights and recommendations for reducing the number and severity of car crashes in Chicago, ensuring the safety of all road users and enhancing the overall well-being of the city's residents.

# 2. BUSINESS PROBLEM

  The business problem we are trying to solve with this research project is the high rate of car crashes in the city of Chicago, which pose a significant risk to public safety and result in a significant financial burden for the city and its residents. Car crashes lead to property damage, personal injury, and loss of life, causing a ripple effect that affects not only the victims but also their families, friends, and the wider community. Additionally, car crashes result in decreased economic productivity, increased healthcare costs, and increased traffic congestion. The objective of this research project is to identify the root causes of car crashes in Chicago and recommend practical solutions to reduce their frequency and severity, thus contributing to the overall safety and well-being of the city and its residents.
  To start, it is important to understand the stakeholders involved in the project and what their motivations and goals are. The primary stakeholders are likely to be the Chicago State Department, local government agencies, and members of the community who are affected by car accidents. The government agencies and the Chicago State Department will be interested in improving road safety and reducing the number of accidents and injuries, while members of the community will be interested in ensuring that the roads they travel on are safe.


## The Problem statement
 
 This project aims to use machine learning techniques to create a predictive model for car crashes in Chicago. The model will analyze a large dataset of crash information to identify key factors that increase the likelihood of a crash and provide insights into relationships between these factors. The goal is to support decision-making for stakeholders involved in road safety initiatives and reduce the frequency and severity of crashes. The project will use the Chicago Traffic Tracker dataset and explore various machine learning algorithms to select the most appropriate model based on its performance. The model will provide valuable information for targeted interventions to improve road safety in Chicago.

## Main Objective

Main Objective: To use machine learning to create a predictive model for car crashes in Chicago and support road safety initiatives.

## 4. DATA UNDERSTANDING



### The Data

The Chicago Traffic Tracker dataset will serve as the primary source of data for this project. This dataset contains information on a large number of car crashes that have occurred in Chicago, including location, time, type of crash, contributing factors, and more. The dataset is rich in information and provides an excellent opportunity to understand the factors that contribute to car crashes in the city.

### Data Preparation

Before building the predictive model, the data will be thoroughly reviewed to gain a deeper understanding of its structure, quality, and potential limitations. This will include an assessment of missing values, outliers, and scale our data to relevant scale that may impact the accuracy of the model. The data will also be transformed as necessary to prepare it for use in machine learning algorithms.


## 5.Exploratory Data Analysis

The goal of this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) section is to gain initial insights into the data on car crashes in Chicago and identify patterns, relationships, and trends that can guide further analysis. The following analysis was performed using a combination of graphical and statistical techniques:

## 6.Data Interpretation

  this project, we analyzed car crashes in the city of Chicago with the goal of understanding the factors that contribute to their frequency and severity. Our findings provide valuable insights into the root causes of car crashes and the trends and patterns of their occurrence in different regions and neighborhoods of the city.

  Based on our analysis, we have identified a range of factors that contribute to car crashes, including driver behavior, road conditions, weather conditions, time of day, and other relevant variables. By understanding the relative importance of these factors and their interactions, we have been able to develop practical solutions to reduce the frequency and severity of car crashes in Chicago.

## 7.CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, this project has provided a comprehensive analysis of car crashes in Chicago and has made a valuable contribution to our understanding of road safety. The results of our analysis will support the development of effective solutions to reduce the frequency and severity of car crashes and contribute to a safer and more sustainable future for the city and its residents.
 
## 8.RECOMMENDATIONS

  Our recommendations for improving road safety include improving road infrastructure, implementing public education and awareness campaigns, and enforcing stricter laws and regulations. These solutions are designed to address the most significant factors that contribute to car crashes and support a safer and more sustainable future for the city and its residents.
